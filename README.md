# Flappy Dragon
## Code from
This program is a result of a tutorial i followed from *Herbert Wolverson's* **Hands-on Rust Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play** book. If you are interested in sharpening your Rust skills this book is probably for you.

It's best if you have a basic knowledge of Rust before starting this book.
## How to Run?
### Install Rust
If you are someone who don't know any Rust or just want to take a look see; first you'll have to install Rust language into your system. Depending on your OS (Windows, Linux or Mac OS X) everything you need to know already almost everywhere on the internet about how to install anything. 

### Compile and Run
So after you install Rust, clone these files to your computer into a folder named *flappy*. Make sure your you have a working internet connection before next step. And then open your terminal in the *flappy* directory and type <code>cargo run</code>. This will take a little bit of time before opening the game. Because before compiling this code needs to download some dependencies to work. Don't worry is about few megabytes. [ðŸ˜„](https://emojikeyboard.org/copy/Smiling_Face_with_Open_Mouth_and_Smiling_Eyes_Emoji_%F0%9F%98%84?utm_source=extlink) Wait a little while it finishes compilation. And then you'll see an ugly and simple game.
